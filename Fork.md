# Why The Fork?!

[elodie](https://github.com/jmathai/elodie) is a powerful tool that addresses a pain point some of us have with managing the sheer number of photos we take in our daily life.  

When using it, one may be faced with some limitations and difficulties achieving the folder classification she has in mind.

Considering how actively maintained the project is and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into it I decided to maintain my
own fork so I can blitz fix the problems I meet without worrying too much about the code maintainability.

## Features

- generate less output folders by using 10 km radius instead of 3 km to determine locations
- replace "Unknown Location" wording by "Unknown"
- replace spaces by underscores in destination filepaths
